# Joniksj Font Pack v4
Hello y'all! Apologies for discontinuing the original Joniksj Font Pack a few years ago. I've recontinued it now.

## Version Support
This pack will have been tested for the following versions:
- Minecraft Java **1.18.1**, **1.18.2**, and **1.19**
- Minecraft Bedrock **1.19**

## Language Support
- (WIP)

### Others
Do check out this cool fork of an older version of this pack that I found: https://github.com/endorpersand/takyonik-font-pack
